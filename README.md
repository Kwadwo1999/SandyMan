# SandyMan
Java Game

SandyMan is a game that was created by me. 
The inspiration behind this game was that I wanted to have a similar feel to PAC-Man because when I was a kid, I used to play PAC-Man a lot. 
This project consists of different classes, methods, Dynamic and Static bodies that are used to create the entire game.
